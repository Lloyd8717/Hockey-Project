# Questions

1. Are advanced statistics (Corsi, Fenwick) better at predicting a playerâ€™s point production than traditional statistics?
2. Are there certain statistics that could show us what is making top defensemen successful at generating points?

## Hypothesis

1. Traditional statistics are better overall at predicting player production than newer advanced statistics.
2. Defensemen who score a large number of points are excelling in certain stats compared to lower-scoring defensemen.
